Next, select 6 images to play the game with. To reverse your selection, simply click the selected image again unselect it. 

Press start to start the game. the 6 images will be used to generate a 12 images made up of pairs of the 6 images and will be randomly situated in a 4x3 grid layout

Upon the start of the game, there will be a count-up timer that will show you the amount of time elapsed since the start of the game.

If your 2 selections do not match, the 2 selections will be flipped back after half a second. If your 2 selection matches, the selections will stay face-up throughout the duration of the game.

Once you have made 6 correct matches, you will be brought to the results page displaying the time taken for you to finish the memory game, with an option to be brought back to the first activity to fetch images to start the game.
